# Cheonwan - Aging Societies in Taiwan and South Korea

## Project Overview
Cheonwan is a data-driven comparison of demographic aging in Taiwan and South Korea. The project aims to analyze the impact of aging populations, identify key policy levers, propose solutions, and guide policy decision-making for sustainable demographic management and resilient social protection systems.

The name "Cheonwan" is derived from the words "Incheon" and "Taiwan," representing the collaboration between team members from both regions.

## Data Analysis
The project analyzes two key metrics:

1. **Aging Index Comparison**: Shows the number of seniors (65+) per 100 children (0–14). Both Taiwan and South Korea experience sharp increases, with South Korea rising more steeply.

2. **Percentage of Population Aged 65+**: Shows the steadily increasing share of people aged 65+ in both countries, with South Korea projected to reach nearly 50% by 2070.

## Key Statistics
- **Taiwan**: By 2025, more than 20% of the population will be 65+, making it a "super-aged society"
- **South Korea**: Fertility fell to 0.72 in 2023 (world's lowest) and the 65+ share is projected to reach 46.4% by 2070

## Proposed Solutions
1. **Increase Employment and Social Participation for Seniors**
   - Offer part-time, remote, and flexible work options
   - Create volunteer opportunities for seniors
   - Provide training programs to help seniors remain in the workforce longer

2. **Enhance Long-Term Care and Health Services**
   - Expand long-term care facilities and home care services
   - Invest in health promotion and disease prevention for seniors
   - Strengthen community care and emergency response systems

3. **Promote Immigration Policies**
   - Open immigration policies to attract young professionals and fill labor gaps
